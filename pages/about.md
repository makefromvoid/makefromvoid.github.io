I'm a dad of two and enjoy making things and tinkering with my aging motorbike. What I lack in skills I make up for in enthusiasm.

As a young boy I used to spend a lot of time with my father in his shed tinkering and making things. I hope to give my children similar happy memories and if they learn something on the way then that is a bonus.
