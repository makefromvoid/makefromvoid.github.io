Guess what, Ikea not only do flat pack furniture, they also do flat pack gingerbread houses!

As with all Ikea assembly jobs, organisation is key, do we have all pieces and fasteners?

Needless to say that assembling these houses is a job for the experts (both of them).

What a combination, gingerbread and icing sugar and art, a match made in heaven.

**Note**: It is extremely important to wear the correct gear, it can't be glamorous enough!
