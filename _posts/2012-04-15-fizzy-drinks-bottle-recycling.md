It is still Easter holidays and looking for another small project I came across SIP's (Sub-irrigated Planters). In our house we never seem to be able to keep those small pots with herbs alive... Basil, chives, coriander, anyone....
SIP's to the rescue. This <a title="article" href="https://greenroofgrowers.blogspot.com/2012/03/lets-make-sips.html">article</a> describes how to make them out of used plastic 2L bottles.

Time to get out the stanley knife and drill...
Cut the bottle.

Then we need to drill air holes..

and 2 happy plants.

They survived for a couple of weeks, a record in our house!
