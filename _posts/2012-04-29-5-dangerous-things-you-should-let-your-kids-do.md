I came across Gever Tulley's <a title="TED Talk" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/gever_tulley_on_5_dangerous_things_for_kids.html">TED talk</a> Â (<a title="YouTube link" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-VacaaN75o&amp;sns=em">YouTube link</a>) and I can't agree more with his message. As a young boy I spent many Saturdays with my father in his shed making / fixing things. <br>
We mainly built things using wood and metal (when I got older I discovered electronics). He always encouraged me under his supervision to use his tools.<br> 
I went through my pictures of the boy and girl and found some inspirational ones.<br>
**Note**: All power tools shown in these pictures were switched off. I love my children dearly and would not endanger them.
2 ways cutting up fallen branches, first we tried a bow saw...

That was too much hard work, so time for power tools.

Not only boys like to help doing jobs...

Once again, the tools were not switched on, had their battery taken out.

And to return to Gever, he runs this tinkering school which seems soooo much fun. Here is a <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/gever_tulley_s_tinkering_school_in_action.html">presentation</a> about the school.
