I came across Gever Tulley's {% include link.html link="https://www.ted.com/talks/gever_tulley_5_dangerous_things_you_should_let_your_kids_do" link_text="TED talk" %} (
 {% include link.html link="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-VacaaN75o&amp;sns=em" link_text="YouTube link" %}) and I can't agree more with his message. As a young boy I spent many Saturdays with my father in his shed making / fixing things. <br>
We mainly built things using wood and metal (when I got older I discovered electronics). He always encouraged me under his supervision to use his tools.<br> 
I went through my pictures of the boy and girl and found some inspirational ones.<br>
**Note**: All power tools shown in these pictures were switched off. I love my children dearly and would not endanger them.
2 ways cutting up fallen branches, first we tried a bow saw...

That was too much hard work, so time for power tools.

Not only boys like to help doing jobs...

Again, the tools were not switched on and/or had their battery taken out...

And to return to Gever, he runs this tinkering school which seems soooo much fun. Here is a {% include link.html link="https://www.tinkeringschool.com/" link_text="link" %} to the school.
