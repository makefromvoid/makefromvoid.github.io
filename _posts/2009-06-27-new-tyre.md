The rear Tyre of my (t)rusty old CB500 needed to be replaced. I could have brought it to the local Bike shop but why not give it a try myself? Naturally I would not have attempted this without my 2 helpers..

A 130/80 17 Bridgestone BT45 (H-RATED series) was ordered from Crossans in Newry (Northern Ireland) costing £74

The first problem was to remove the old Tyre from the Rim. I found a handy way on YouTube...
First we drill a hole so that we can get the jig saw in.

Saw all the way around the tyre in order to half it.

'Breaking the bead' is hard, one way of getting the Tyre off the rim is to depress it with something heavy (my beloved Jeep Cherokee).

After breaking some sweat this is the result, the dishwashing liquid is used when putting the new Tyre on.

After the Tyre was mounted the balance needed to be checked. Using the rear axle and a perfectly level step ladder I established that the existing balancing was Ok. Well at least for the speeds I'm going at.

After all this the most important job is cleaning the old Tyre.

I also had help cleaning the drum brake housing. He loves the smell of Petrol...
