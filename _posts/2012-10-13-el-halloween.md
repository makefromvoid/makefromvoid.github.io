Following all the press around the new TRON movie I came across an article about EL-Wire ({% include link.html link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroluminescent_wire" link_text="wikipedia" %}) and and it looked like a fun and easy way to light up a costume. Since Halloween was around the corner I went and bought 2 EL-Wire kits from {% include link.html link="http://elwirecraft.co.uk" link_text="EL Wire Craft" %}.<br>
Each kit came with 3 x 1m strands of EL Wire (one kit had Orange and the other had Lime Green wire) a Driver and a splitter for the 3 strands.

These kits are vey easy to work with, the drivers take 2 AA batteries and the wire can be sowed to clothing. We repurposed previous years customers and sowed the 2 colours of EL wire to each costume.

The costumes came out great, they were a great hit with the neighbours ;-)

Needless to say the haul of sweets was impressive.
