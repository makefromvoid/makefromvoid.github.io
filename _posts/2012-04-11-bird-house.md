The Easter holidays are here and what better time to make a bird house. Well actually it is way too late to put up a house, it takes a while for the birds to find it after you put it up. The best time to put up a birds house is in Autumn so that the birds have a chance to find it..
Anyway, that's not stopping us. There are plenty of examples on the web, here is an <a title="example" href="http://www.livios.be/nl/_build/_surr/_asse/6700.asp">example</a>.
Here is the plan..

I found a leftover piece of 18mm ply from the work bench project. Figuring out the cuts is an ideal way of practicing some of the math we have learned in school (quaternions mainly since we are working in 3D Space).

Even though she had a fracture in her collar bone Tess was all up for helping to assemble.

Quality Control is taken seriously around here..
