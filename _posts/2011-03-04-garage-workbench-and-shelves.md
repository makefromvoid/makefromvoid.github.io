Our garage was in need of a work bench but with all the 'stuff' spread all over there was no space to put one. So first we built some shelves so that I could actually enter the garage. And then a nice solid work bench needed to be build.

A couple of sheets of Plywood were ordered (244 x 122 cm) together with some '2 x 4's.

Again I had great help putting it all together.

Each shelf was exactly one half of a sheet of ply wood, so minimal cutting of these sheets was required. Field test result are shown below. I'm very happy with how sturdy they are.

Next was the work bench, I don't have a finished picture but this is to give an idea.

Must take a picture of the finished product...
