I came across a blog post on a website called www.origamimommy.org (Update Feb 2021: site seems no longer operational) about making toy trucks out of milk cartons. Origami Mummy is a great blog and the projects on it are amazing. I thought the truck build would be a nice little project for myself and Sean. I ordered a hot glue gun on Amazon and started collecting milk cartons.

Here are 2 pictures of the build in progress...

Sean had great fun working with the hot glue gun and building the truck.
