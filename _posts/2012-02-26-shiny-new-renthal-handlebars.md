For my birthday my mate Henry gave me a set of handlebars to replace the vintage ones on the CB500. Naturally like everything else on the bike the old bars were rusty as you can see below.

Unfortunately the new bars were a little bit too straight for an old man like me so I sold them online and ordered a set of Renthal 'Road Bike Low' bars (Renthal part# 754-01-SI) from demon-tweeks.co.uk (£36.25 including shipping).

The dimensions of the new bars are listed below:

The 'Road Low' bars match the stock CB500 bars pretty close, the Renthals are a little bit wider as you cab see below.

I needed to shorten the bars since the brake, throttle and clutch cables are pretty tightly routed and I did not want to replace all of these yet.

Time to take the angle-grinder out. It can be tricky to make a straight cut on a tube and I found a trick using a pipe-cutter online.

After marking the bar with the pipe-cutter it was simply a case of following the line with the angle-grinder. Even a 4 year old in her pretty new dress can do that (under supervision of her older brother of course).

Tess took about an inch off both sides.

There were holes in the original bars for 'locking' the throttle and clutch 'grips. I replicated these holes in the new bars. I guess I could have cut of the 'tabs' in the grips as well.

And here is the result, the bars are just the right width as Tess demonstrates. I'm vey happy with them, it is amazing how much less they vibrate. For the first time I'm able to use the mirrors when I'm driving ;-)

PS. Here is a tip from Tess, if you like my Dad suffer from 'Helmet Hair' then invest in a hair band with a large flower!
