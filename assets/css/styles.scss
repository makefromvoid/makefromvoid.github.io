// This (/assets/css/styles.scss) is the main / entrypoint Sass file, by having empty front matter 
// it gets automatically processed by the Jekyll SCSS Converter, 
// see https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/07-assets/ for details
// The output css file is placed in _site/assets e.g. _site/assets/styles.css 
// _site/assets/styles.css is referenceced in head.html:head.link.stylesheet

// Note: order of processing is from top to bottom so styles in the last sass override those in the first sass

@import "bootstrap/bootstrap";
@import "custom/includes/navbar";
@import "custom/includes/jumbotron";
