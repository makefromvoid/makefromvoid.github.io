<p>Halloween is nearing and again I'm looking for a project for the boy and girl. In the past I have purchased an attend breakout board from tinkerlog and one of the projects I liked was a 64 pixel animated LED Matrix. Here is the link to the <a href="http://tinkerlog.com/howto/64pixels/">original article</a>.</p>
<p>I thought it would be nice to have the boy and girl draw the animations themselves on a 8 by 8 grid and maybe even have them decode the images from binary to decimal format....</p>
<p>Here is the girl drawing one 'frame'</p>
<p><a href="https://makefromvoid.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/2013-10-20-12_small.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-173" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2013-10-20-12_small.jpg" alt="2013-10-20 12_Small" width="599" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>And a close up, no fear here ;-) For each row they had to add the individual bits to calculate the 'row' value. The image below shows the 2 frames making up a bunny which blinks and flops one ear.</p>

<p>I pretty much followed Alex's instructions, I had to put a zener in to drop a volt, the LED's were a little bit to bright.</p>
<p>Here is the circuit on a breadboard, note I use Alex's attend <a href="http://tinkerlog.com/howto/tiny2313-header/">Attiny</a> header, the LED Matrix is a <a href="http://www.futurlec.com/LED/LEDM88G.shtml">LEDM88G</a> from Futurlec.</p>
